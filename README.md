# Bank-Management-System
Financial management with a simple Bank System that lets users create an account with a basic registration system, not to mention deposit and withdraw money.

This was our first foray into OOP, so let’s break down what we’ve done in this C++ project to create our banking system:

We defined a BankAccount class with private member variables for account name and balance. We provided public methods (deposit, withdraw, display) for account operations. The main function allows the user to create a bank account with an initial deposit, before letting them deposit, withdraw, or display account information via a do-while loop. The switch statement in the main function handles user choices for banking operations. This C++ project is designed to give the basic skills while also challenging to layer in  other basic C++ knowledge.
